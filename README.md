ðŸ˜Š Tweet Sentiment Analyzer

Analyze the mood of tweets instantly!
An end-to-end sentiment analysis system that predicts whether a tweet is positive or negative using a trained ensemble machine learning model. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, this project includes preprocessing, model training, and a sleek, interactive web interface.

âœ¨ Key Features
Smart Preprocessing: Cleans tweets by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and extra spaces.

Powerful Ensemble Modeling: Combines Logistic Regression and Linear SVM for better predictions.

Real-Time Sentiment: Get instant feedback on any tweet you enter.

Confidence Score: Shows how strongly the model believes in its prediction.

Interactive UI: Color-coded sentiment display and visual confidence bar.

Reproducible: Fully saved models and vectorizers for easy reuse.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project is Cool
End-to-End Pipeline: From raw tweets â†’ preprocessing â†’ model â†’ live web app.

Data-Driven Insights: Evaluated on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Fast & Efficient: Optimized for speed without losing prediction quality.
